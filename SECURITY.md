# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest tagged release and `main` branch receive security fixes. Please update to the most recent version of preflight-tools before reporting an issue; older releases may already include fixes for known vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in preflight-tools or its dependencies:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
2. Email the maintainers at **security@syzygysys.io** with:
   - A description of the vulnerability and potential impact
   - Steps to reproduce (proof of concept)
   - Any relevant logs or stack traces
   - Your contact information for follow-up

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours, investigate promptly, and coordinate a patch or mitigation plan. Once the fix is released, we’ll credit you (unless you prefer anonymity) in the changelog.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before discussing it publicly. If the issue affects third-party dependencies, we’ll coordinate with the upstream maintainers where possible.

## Preferred Languages

We accept disclosure reports in English.
